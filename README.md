## Building

The project uses pipenv or dependency management. In the project root directory run:

## Install Dependencies

```sh
pipenv install
```

## Activate virtual environment

```sh
pipenv shell
```

## setup environment variables

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add some random environment variables

## Setup database migrations

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
```

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

## Run the project

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

This will spawn a local development server on [localhost:8000](localhost:8000). The swagger UI enables you to test the functionality directly in your browser without needing an external API client
